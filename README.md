# Welcome to the SMG RE TypeScript Coding Interview

## Introduction

Welcome to the SMG RE TypeScript coding interview! We appreciate your interest in joining our team, and this interview is designed to help us better understand your TypeScript knowledge and problem-solving skills.

The interview consists of two parts: theoretical questions and practical exercises. Please carefully read and follow the instructions for each part.

## General Guidelines

Before you begin, please take a moment to read through the following guidelines:

1. **Understanding the Exercise**: It's crucial to thoroughly understand the exercises before you start. If you have any questions or need clarification on any part of the process or exercises, feel free to ask.

2. **Thought Process**: We encourage you to speak out loud while solving the problems. Sharing your thought process with us helps us gain insight into your understanding and problem-solving approach.

3. **No External Resources**: During the interview, we kindly request that you do not use any external resources, such as Google or Stack Overflow. We want to assess your skills without outside assistance. If necessary you can skip questions or exercises in order to stay within the defined time-box.
